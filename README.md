# Coding Backyard

An accumulated progress trough these years, up until summer of 2022. Everything from my projects to competitive programming tasks is stored here.
I used this repositry to sync libraries between my laptop and PC and it saved all of my expierence as a side effect. 
I tried to keep my directories ordered, but it ended up being a pure chaos, so I wish you good luck finding something interesting here...
